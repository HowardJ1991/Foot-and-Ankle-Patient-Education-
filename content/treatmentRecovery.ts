*   **Sizing:** Your doctor will help size your crutches. There should be a 1-2 inch gap between your armpit and the crutch pad. Your handgrips should be at wrist level, allowing for a slight bend in your elbow.
*   **Walking:** Place the crutches about one foot ahead of you. Lean on your hands, not your armpits, and swing your body forward. Land on your good foot.
*   **Stairs:** To go up, lead with your good foot ("up with the good"). To go down, lead with your crutches and injured foot ("down with the bad").

Paul Schroeder, M.D.
Orthopaedic Surgery, Foot and Ankle Reconstruction

### INTRODUCTION
Patients often have similar questions after surgery. Sometimes these questions cause frustration and unnecessary worry. Therefore, we have listed
commonly asked questions with our answers to help relieve extra stress that may occur after surgery.
Please do not hesitate to call if an answer is unclear or if you have a different question.
You will start taking the medications prescribed by Dr. Schroeder, the evening after surgery

### QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

### 1) What should I do when my foot hurts after surgery?
You will be given pain medications which are very strong. The strongest medication is a narcotic (OPIOID MEDICATION) and is addictive in nature.
However, you do not have to worry that you will become addicted while taking it for a very short time.
The medications we frequently use are meloxicam, Tylenol, gabapentin, oxycodone, aspirin, Vit D, Zofran and Colace. The night after surgery, you
may take 1 Oxycodone tablets every 4 hours as needed. Usually by the second or third day after surgery your foot will begin to feel better and you
will require much less pain medication. Sometimes if you wait until the pain is very severe before taking your medications, the pill will not work
immediately and may take up to one hour before you feel some relief. Therefore, we recommend that you start the medication even with mild pain
the first night after surgery.
The other pain medications out of the ones above are: (1) Meloxicam (pain relieving anti-inflammatory, taken once daily with food. Do not combine
with ibuprofen, Advil, Celebrex, Aleve, or naproxen), (2) Tylenol, and (3) Gabapentin. These will be the three main pain medications to use. We
want you to stop the oxycodone ASAP. Aspirin is to prevent blood clots. Vit D is to help your bones heal and strengthen. Zofran is to help nausea.
Colace is to prevent constipation.
Elevation is also excellent in relieving pain. Keep your foot above ethe level of you heart as much as possible to decrease the swelling and tension
in your leg/foot. Ice is also great at numbing pain. Do not place ice directly on your skin.

### 2) What should I do about nausea and vomiting?
Many patients have nausea after surgery when taking pain medications. If the nausea and vomiting are severe, we will need to prescribe a
medication in a suppository form. You should contact our office for help or if it is severe enough you may need to go to the emergency room.

### 3) What should I do if I have fever?
A fever is quite common after surgery for several days. You may even have some slight chills and sweating. If you have a low-grade fever, This you
should make an effort to cough and breathe deeply to clear congestion from your lungs. If your temperature is measured over 101 degrees, please
call to inform us.

### 4) What should I do if I see blood or drainage on my bandages?
Many patients bleed through onto their bandages after surgery or have drainage. Please do not let this alarm you. If there is a significant amount of
blood, you may wrap extra gauze on top of your bandages. Please do not remove the initial bandage since this is sterile and we want to maintain
cleanliness around the wound until we change the dressing. If bleeding or drainage continues despite reinforcement, please walk into USAFA
Orthopaedic Clinic in the 10th Medical Group to see the cast room for a dressing change during normal business hours (7:30am to 4:30pm). You
can call ahead to let us know, but you do not need a formal appointment.
This would also apply if your bandage gets wet, blood is dry on the bandage or bandage will not stay on. No need to call the office if this is the issue.
If the bandage slips off the foot, you can use tape to hold it on or you come into one of our offices.
If you have issues after normal clinic hours, you will need to go to Fort Carson Emergency Room or an off base urgent care or emergency room to be
evaluated. Please call and leave us a voicemail or send us an email if you are being seen. We will contact you the following business day.

### 5) When do I come back to see the doctor?
When patients have their surgery and go home the same day, we usually see the patient in the office one or two weeks after the operation.
Occasionally, we will have your first post operative appointment 3 weeks after surgery. At your first post op appointment, we will perform a wound
check and change your bandages. We may also obtain x-rays as well, but we typically wait until 4-6weeks after surgery for x-rays. If you do not
know your appointment date, please call our main orthopaedic clinic line: 719-333-5040.

### 6) When can I shower or bathe?
Often, we will keep a snug compression bandage on your foot for several weeks after surgery or a splint/cast. You should not get this bandage wet.
If the bandage should become wet, we will need to change it. Therefore, you should keep your leg/foot dry until your post operative dressing is
removed in our clinic at your first post operative appointment. It is normal to not see your foot for a few weeks after surgery.
You may shower by placing a large garbage bag over your splint and Duct taping it to your skin above the splint â€“ do not submerge your leg under
water. Do not try to merely put a rubber band at the top of the plastic bag as it will not create a tight enough seal and water will get down inside. If it
gets wet, you will need to come into clinic as soon as possible (you do not need an appointment). Over the weekend or over the holidays,
you will need to go to a local urgent care or ED to get the bandage exchanged. Please contact us if this happens as we want to see you as
soon as possible to examine your wound and change your dressing into one that we place. Do not let your foot remain in a wet splint or
dressing as this can lead to an infection or wound healing issue. If it happens overnight, and you are able to come into our USAFA clinic first
thing in the morning you can remove the dressings and cover your wound with sterile gauze and an ACE wrap then proceed to come into our
clinic at 0730 in the morning.
The alternative to a shower is to take sponge baths.
 You can typically get your incisions wet in the shower 2-4weeks after your surgery when cleared by your doctor. You cannot submerge it under
water for at least 6weeks or when the wound is 100% healed without any scabs, whichever is later. If it gets wet early, you are at increased risk for
infection or wound healing issues.

### 7) What should I do if the bandages come off?
The bandages are placed in a very specific fashion. If the bandages are removed or come off, please place a sterile gauze pad over the wound and
cover it with gauze wrap. We should see you in the office the same day or the following day to replace your bandage. If your bandage becomes
saturated in blood, you should come to our USAFA Orthopaedic Clinic and ask to be seen in the cast room for a dressing change.

### 8) Should I walk on my foot or do I need to use crutches?
Prior to some surgeries you will be given crutches, a walker, or a knee scooter. Your weight-bearing status will be reviewed with you prior to
discharge. Most patients find that using crutches or a walker for the first week after surgery makes walking more comfortable. Some patients
should not place any weight on their foot. If this is the case, we will instruct you not to walk at all on your foot. Please use crutches, walker, or knee
scooter until told otherwise.
Regardless of your weight bearing status after surgery, you should minimize the amount you are up on your foot after surgery until your wound
heals and the stitches are removed. The more you have your foot not elevated above the level of your heart, the more your foot will swell. This will
increase the time it will take for your incision to heal and the swelling will make your foot hurt worse.

### 9) How long do I have to wear the post op shoe/sandal or boot?
You should wear the hard sole shoe/sandal or boot when walking or moving until we inform you otherwise. The device adds needed support to your
foot. Your foot or ankle can be severely damaged if you walk without it. Even if you are not putting weight on your foot, you must still wear you post
op shoe or boot when ambulating. This will help protect your foot and ankle if you slip and fall and must put weight down on your foot.

### 10) When will the numbness wear off from my foot?
We usually numb your foot during surgery. Sometimes it takes up to twenty-four hours for the numbness to go away. You may continue to have
some numbness in your toes after this time because the nerves can be slightly bruised or stretched during surgery. Occasionally this numbness in
the toes will last several months or may be permanent, although this is uncommon.

### 11) When will the stitches be removed?
We usually remove the stitches 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. If you miss your appointment because of an emergency, do not be alarmed because the
stitches can remain in place for many weeks without causing harm.

### 12) What do I do about swelling around my toes and behind my bandage?
All patients have a significant amount of swelling around their bandage and foot after surgery. This swelling may last for many months (6+). After
surgery, you should elevate your foot higher than your heart to decrease swelling. This is particularly critical for several days after surgery while
your incision is healing. Increased swelling puts increased pressure on the edges of your incision and may cause it to split open slightly. Once the
wound is healed, the swelling will not harm your surgical recovery. If you are concerned about a significant amount of swelling or redness, please
call for an appointment.

### 13) How do I know if my foot is infected?
Many patients will have a slight drainage of yellowish fluid for several weeks after surgery. This does not mean your foot is infected. Severe wound
infections usually occur from five to ten days after surgery. If you notice extreme swelling, increased pain, or extreme redness please contact us
immediately. Usually if we treat an infection early with antibiotics future surgery can be avoided.

### 14) When can I drive?
We will need to discuss this on an individual basis, but it always is your responsibility to make the decision if you are safe to drive. Typically, if you
are in a walking boot you should not drive.

### 15) When are the pins removed from my foot?
We often use pins to hold proper alignment. Sometimes you will notice the tip of the pin has a small cap. Please feel free to touch this pin. If you
bump it on the bed covers or on a hard object, do not worry because this will not damage your surgery.
I remove the pin in the office 4 to 6 weeks after your surgery, depending on how your healing progresses. Patients often comment that there is less
discomfort from removing the pin than removing the stitches.

### 16) What do I do if I feel that my bandage is too tight?
The bandage is placed in a very specific fashion and should be snug to decrease swelling in the foot. However, if your dressing feels entirely too
tight, you may split it slightly along the inside and outside borders of the foot. Please do not remove your bandage totally since it is placed in a
sterile fashion. Call if you are concerned.

### 17) How do I know if I have a blood clot or deep venous thromboembolism (DVT)?
All patients who have surgery, an injury to a limb (especially a lower extremity), and are not putting full weight on their leg are at increased risk for a
blood clot. This risk increases even higher if you are sitting for a prolonged period of time (i.e. long road trip or on a flight), have cancer, on
hormonal therapy, have a history of a blood clot or you or a close family member have certain blood disorders. I typically prescribe Aspirin 81mg
(baby aspirin, same medication you can find at any pharmacy) twice daily to help decrease this risk. If you have a positive history of blood clots, I
may prescribe a different medication either Eliquis 2.5mg twice daily orally or Lovenox 40mg injection once daily.
Signs that concern me of a blood clot in your leg are new increased redness or swelling in your foot, calf or behind your knee after your leg was
already improving. New cramping or pain in your calf or behind your knee. If you experience these symptoms call us immediately and will direct
you to the next step (i.e. come to clinic, go to the ER or go to radiology for an ultrasound). Obtaining an ultrasound is a quick way to determine if you
have a blood clot.
Rarely, the blood clot can break off in your blood stream and travel to your lungs, this is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). This is a serious
medical issue that can result in significant morbidity or even fatality. Signs of this include new onset chest pain and even coughing up blood that
is not related to trauma. Should you experience this you need to go to an emergency room immediately.

### 18) When can I fly?
It is recommended that you do not fly for at least 4 weeks following surgery to ensure your wound is completely healed. I understand that there are
life circumstances where you may need to fly early so if you must travel please inform your surgeon as they may need to change your medications
to prevent blood clots, prescribed TED hoses, and/or give you more specific instructions on getting up and walking around on the plane to minimize
your risk of getting a blood clot.
Traveling through airports is a difficult task especially after surgery. It will take much more time than if you were not injured. You are also at an
increased risk of falling given the crowds. Ideally, you do not plan any vacations for at least 3 months following your so you can maximize your
enjoyment and not be as hindered due to your recent surgery.`,

### Overview
Below are generalized post-operative timelines and rehabilitation guidelines. They are intended to provide a broad overview of how recovery may progress. Every surgical recovery is personalized to fit each patientâ€™s needs. Speed of recovery depends on clinical exam findings, radiographic evaluation, and the time elapsed since surgery.

This is not an all-encompassing list and is subject to change based on your specific procedure, healing, and surgeon guidance.

### Weeks 0â€“2
*   Strict rest and elevation of the operative leg.
*   Non-weightbearing unless otherwise instructed.
*   Maintain surgical dressings, keep clean and dry.
*   Begin gentle toe wiggling to promote circulation (if cleared).

### Weeks 2â€“6
*   Stitches typically removed between 2â€“4 weeks.
*   Transition into protective boot, cast, or brace as directed.
*   Continue elevation to reduce swelling.
*   Begin gentle range-of-motion (ROM) exercises if cleared by surgeon.
*   Still avoid immersion of incision until fully healed.

### Weeks 6â€“12
*   Gradual increase in activity.
*   Possible transition from non-weightbearing to partial or full weightbearing depending on procedure.
*   Physical therapy often initiated for mobility and strength.
*   Focus on gait training, balance, and restoring flexibility.

### Months 3â€“6
*   Increase strengthening and endurance training.
*   Begin more advanced functional exercises (balance boards, resistance bands, light weights).
*   Return to low-impact activities (walking, stationary bike, swimming) when cleared.

### Months 6â€“12+
*   Progress toward higher-impact activities (running, jumping, sports) if permitted.
*   Long-term swelling may persist for up to 12â€“18 months.
*   Focus remains on strength, endurance, and injury prevention.

### Key Reminders
*   Always follow weightbearing restrictions given by your surgeon.
*   Pain and swelling are normal but should gradually improve.
*   Notify your provider immediately if you experience severe pain, increasing redness, drainage, or other concerns.
*   Every patientâ€™s timeline may differ â€“ do not compare your recovery speed to others.`,

    content: `### Multimodal Analgesia (Pain medications)
Paul Schroeder, MD
Orthopaedic Surgery, Foot and Ankle Reconstruction

To provide you with the best control of your pain after surgery, you will receive prescriptions for multiple medicines that attack pain in different ways and limit the amount of opioid (habit forming) pain medicines that you will need. No amount of medicine will ever make you pain free, the goal is to make the pain level tolerable.

This combination of medicines has been demonstrated to be far better at controlling pain than any of these medications alone. Remember to keep your leg elevated above your heart after surgery and to use ice packs on your splint (never on skin) for 20 minutes each hour. Relaxing music and aroma therapy (lavender) are excellent adjuncts that have been shown to reduce anxiety and pain after surgery.

Start taking your post operative medications the evening after surgery as the nerve block will wear off in the middle of the night.

### Meloxicam
An anti-inflammatory medicine that blocks the chemicals in the body that cause pain and swelling. Take with food, most common side effects are upset stomach. Do not take with Ibuprofen, Advil, Naproxen, Aleve, Celebrex, or oral Diclofenac. Take one 15mg pill once per day. 30 pills provided.

### Acetaminophen
This is the main ingredient in Tylenol and is combined with opiates to make medicines like Percocet and Lortab. It blocks pain receptors in your nervous system. This is a larger dose than what one would take over-the-counter, but not large enough to harm you. Take 1000mg three times per day. 90 pills provided.

### Gabapentin
This medicine affects the way neurotransmitters are released in the body. It is commonly used to treat nerve pain or neuropathy. This medicine is not habit forming and the most common side effect is drowsiness, similar to a Benadryl. Take one 300mg pill three times per day. 60 pills provided.

### Oxycodone
This is an opioid medication that can be addictive. Try to limit the use of this medication to as needed for breakthrough pain, especially during the first several nights after surgery. You can take one 5mg pill every 4 to 6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain, but try to wean off of this as soon as possible.

Your goal is to wean yourself down to just using Meloxicam, Acetaminophen, and Gabapentin only by a few days after surgery. Call our office anytime with questions.

### Other Medications (Aiding Recovery)
*   **Aspirin 81mg:** Take this twice a day with food. This is to prevent blood clots. Take until you are told otherwise.
*   **Vitamin D 50,000 units:** Take this once weekly. Take until you are told otherwise.
*   **Zofran 4mg:** This is to prevent Nausea. Take only if needed.
*   **Colace 100mg:** This is to help with constipation, which is a side effect of taking an opioid. Take only if needed.

### EXAMPLE TIME SCHEDULE:
Scheduled (whether you feel pain or not)
*   Meloxicam 15 mg once per day (7AM)
*   Gabapentin 300 mg three times per day (7AM, 3PM, 11PM)
*   Tylenol 1000 mg three times per day (7AM, 3PM, 11PM)
*   Aspirin 81 mg twice per day (7AM, 11 PM)
*   Vitamin D 50,000 units once per WEEK`,

Paul Schroeder, M.D.
Orthopaedic Surgery, Foot and Ankle Reconstruction

### Goals â€“ first two weeks after surgery:
REST, ELEVATE your foot, take your medications, and keep your post-op dressing clean, dry, and intact.

### Swelling
Please note it can take up to 6 to 12 months for swelling to go away in your toes, foot, or ankle. This is to be expected. The more you elevate, ice, and keep compressive wraps on your foot and ankle the quicker this will resolve. You can ice your leg/foot or place it behind your knee to help with pain. The standard postoperative dressings are bulky so you will not feel the ice through the dressing, so you may not ice your leg until after your first postoperative appointment.

### Wound, Bandage, and Splint Care
There is no wound care to be done by you in the first few weeks following surgery. Keep your splint and/or post operative bandages in place and do not remove them. Keep the dressings clean and dry. Do not attempt to put anything down the splint/cast, as this can cause a skin tear/cut and will increase risk of infection.

It is normal to not see your incision for 2â€“3 weeks after surgery. We will remove your surgical dressings and/or post operative splint at your first post operative appointment. Stitches remain in place for 2â€“4 weeks.

You may shower by placing a large garbage bag over your splint and duct taping it to your skin above the splint â€“ do not submerge your leg under water. Do not try to merely put a rubber band at the top of the plastic bag as it will not create a tight enough seal and water will get down inside. If it gets wet, you will need to come into clinic as soon as possible (you do not need an appointment).

Over the weekend or holidays, you will need to go to a local urgent care or ED to get the bandage exchanged. Please contact us if this happens as we want to see you as soon as possible to examine your wound and change your dressing into one that we place.

You can typically get your incisions wet in the shower 2â€“4 weeks after your surgery when cleared by your doctor. You cannot submerge it under water for at least 6 weeks or when the wound is 100% healed without any scabs, whichever is later.

### Activity
During the first two weeks, it is key to rest your foot and ankle as much as possible. Please minimize ambulation and keep your foot elevated above your chest/heart as much as possible. This will help the incision heal and help your pain and recovery. Your main job is to lay down, elevate your foot, and only get up to go to the bathroom and for meals. Avoid extended periods of sitting with the leg below your waist or extended periods of standing/walking as these activities are likely to increase swelling.

### Weight Bearing
Remain non-weight bearing to your operative leg until you are cleared by Dr. Schroeder. Please use your crutches, walker, and/or knee scooter to mobilize.

### Return to School/Work
You may return to sedentary work or school if swelling and pain are tolerable, and you are no longer taking narcotic pain medications. You need to take at least two weeks off so you can focus on your surgical recovery and get better sooner.

### Additional Guidance

### Recovery Timeline
On average, it takes about 3 months for you to get to 60â€“70% improved, but 12â€“18 months to reach maximal improvement. All timelines and speed of recovery are subject to change based on time from surgery, clinical reassessments, wound healing, and radiographs.

### Walking Boot
If you are wearing a walking boot, you must always cover your incision with an ACE wrap to prevent wound irritation, abrasions, and breakdown.

### Driving
*   Right foot surgery impairs your ability to drive. Typically, you should not drive until you are no longer wearing a walking boot, off all narcotic medications, and are able to bear weight comfortably on your foot in sneakers.
*   Left foot surgery impairs your ability to drive while you are on narcotic pain medications or if you drive a manual vehicle and are in a walking boot.
*   You should plan not to drive for at least two weeks following surgery regardless of which foot had surgery.

### Medications
1.  Aspirin: 81mg twice daily to prevent blood clots. Do not skip this medication. You will take this for at least 6 weeks and until you are walking without a boot.
2.  Vitamin D: 50,000 units once weekly Ã— 12 weeks to help your bone heal.
3.  Tylenol: Take as prescribed on the bottle (no more than 3,000mg/24 hours).
4.  Meloxicam (Mobic): 15mg once daily (take with food; this is an NSAID; do not take with Ibuprofen, Advil, Naproxen, Aleve, Diclofenac; do not take if you have CKD).
5.  Gabapentin: 300mg three times daily; this is for nerve pain and can help with sleep.
6.  Opioid (Tramadol, Oxycodone, Norco, Percocet): Breakthrough pain only. Take with food, minimize the amount you take, addictive so stop using ASAP. Dr. Schroeder typically prescribes Oxycodone 5mg for the first few days following surgery.
7.  Colace: 100mg twice daily; this is for constipation. Opioids can cause constipation, take as needed.
8.  Zofran: 4mg every 8 hours for nausea, if needed.`,

### Weight Bearing
You can place your foot down on the ground for balance and partial weight bearing with crutches, walker, and/or knee scooter. You must wear your post operative shoe/sandal/boot on your operative foot when you are up mobilizing and walking even if you are using your crutches, walker, or scooter. Try to keep as much weight on your heel as possible. Please only walk for short distances while your wound is healing. The first two weeks is key for elevation and rest.

7.  Colace: 100mg twice daily; this is for constipation. Opioids can cause constipation, take as needed.
8.  Zofran: 4mg every 8 hours for nausea, if needed.`,

### Boot Usage
* The ONLY time you wear the boot is when you are up and around (going to the bathroom, walking, etc.).
* You may leave the boot off when sitting or elevating.
* You DO NOT need to sleep in the boot.

### Wound and Skin Protection
* Always keep something between the boot/shoe and your skin.
* This can be ACE wraps, long thick socks, or equivalent padding.
* The boot can rub on your skin or wounds â€” pad it well to avoid irritation and breakdown.

### Night Care
* Sleep in the ACE wraps to minimize swelling.
* Do not sleep in the boot itself.

### Additional Notes
* Keep your incision and dressings clean, dry, and intact until cleared by your surgeon.
* Contact the clinic immediately if you notice increased redness, swelling, drainage, or signs of infection.`,

### Dressing Care
* Leave your surgical dressings in place until your first post-operative appointment.
* Keep your dressings clean, dry, and intact.
* Do NOT attempt to remove or change them yourself.

### Showering
* Place a large garbage bag over your splint/dressing and secure it with duct tape above the site to keep it dry.
* Do not submerge your foot under water.
* Do not rely on a rubber band at the top â€” it will not seal tightly and water will leak in.
* If your bandage gets wet, come into the clinic as soon as possible for an exchange. If it happens over a weekend or holiday, go to a local urgent care or ER.

### Skin & Wound Protection
* Do not put any objects or powders down into your splint or cast.
* If your bandage slips, reinforce it with tape or ACE wrap until you are seen in clinic.

### Follow-Up
* Your stitches will usually stay in place for 2â€“4 weeks.
* Your incision will be checked, and bandages changed, at your first post-operative appointment.`,
