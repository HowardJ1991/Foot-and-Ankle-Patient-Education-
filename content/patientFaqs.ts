  'Ankle Fusion vs. Ankle Replacement': {
    content: `Many patients with moderate to severe arthritis of the ankle have fairly disabling pain which interferes with quality of life, daily and recreational activities. Usually a serious attempt is made to relieve the pain with a combination of medications, bracing, injection therapy, and sometimes outpatient surgery to remove bone spurs and other debris in the ankle. Assuming this has been tried, sometimes the option of ankle fusion versus ankle replacement is presented for improved pain relief. The following is a summary of the discussion we will likely have in the office. Keep in mind that not every patient, for various reasons, is a candidate for one or the other surgery.
The following is certainly not a complete list of the issues involved in this decision, but is does summarize the major points. More information can be found at www.orthoinfo.org.

### Ankle fusion:
What does it mean? Removal of the surfaces of the ankle joint, placing bone graft (either taken from another part of your body or donated, processed bone), and finally placing metal screws and or plate to hold the bone still while it grows together.
### Advantages:
*   Gold standard for pain relief. Most patients report significantly improved pain and function. Improved ability to walk and perform regular daily activities. Once healed, patients rarely develop further ankle joint problems and thus achieve a permanent solution to ankle arthritis.
*   Surgery often less invasive. Many ankle fusions can be performed in the outpatient surgery center through relatively small incisions. General anesthesia is required, however. The use of a special anesthetic injection behind the knee is sometimes used for prolonged pain relief.
### Disadvantages:
*   Some loss of motion or movement at the ankle area. There are other adjacent joints that provide some of the same movement, so many patients are surprised at the remaining movement. If these joints do not have arthritis, you should expect to feel like you still have 30-40% of normal movement.
*   Adjacent joint arthritis. The ankle joint absorbs some of the energy and weight of walking, and after fusion the other joints will have to absorb this energy and typically will develop arthritis sooner than if the ankle joint were normal. Sometimes further treatment is required for these joints if this happens.
*   Knee, hip or back pain. Even the loss of just part of the motion can place more stress on these areas. Most patients who have this surgery already limp so much from their ankle arthritis that the fusion tends to not worsen the other joint problems.
*   Failure to heal the fusion. Ankle fusion must heal to give maximum pain relief. The failure rate is approximately 10%. Everyone is different, and there are things that can be done to improve your odds of a successful fusion. If it does not heal, there are treatments to stimulate the healing, but occasionally further surgery is required.
*   Cast immobilization. Casting is required until healed, sometimes up to three months or longer.
*   Other complications (rare): infection rate less than 1%, blood clot in the leg, loss of sensation in a part of the foot, need to remove the metal at a later time.

### Can the ankle fusion be converted to an ankle replacement?
Technically it is sometimes possible to do this, but it is a fairly complicated procedure and we do not plan to do this when we select ankle fusion as the procedure.

### Other notes:
*   A knee walker is a great help after surgery, and it is helpful to practice beforehand. We have a device in our physical therapy department and can instruct you in its use.
*   Return to work is highly variable, but almost never before two weeks, even for a sedentary job.
*   Like any surgery on a weight bearing joint, it takes at least a year before the full benefits of surgery are realized and the body gets used to having a fused (or replaced) ankle.

### Who is the ideal patient for ankle fusion as opposed to replacement?
Typically younger, more active patients who do not have any other arthritis in the adjacent joints. Although there are certainly patients who return to tennis and moderate impact activities, I usually recommend low to no impact aerobic activities. Cycling, hiking, and similar activities are often possible.

### Ankle replacement
What does it mean?
Removal of the opposing sides of the arthritic ankle joint and replacing them with a metal and plastic device that recreates the surface of the joint.
### Advantages:
*   Pain relief. Most ankle replacement patients report good to excellent relief of their pain after surgery. It can be dramatic at times.
*   Retention of some ankle motion. Although ankle motion after an ankle replacement is rarely that of a normal ankle, most patients will retain some motion of the joint, potentially relieving stress on the other joints of the foot and the knee and hip.
*   Bone healing is not required as it is with a fusion. Bone usually grows partially into the implant, but is not required to heal completely for a satisfactory outcome.
*   Slightly less time in a cast. Patients usually spend 4-6 weeks in a cast as opposed to 8-12 weeks with a fusion, but physical therapy is required as opposed to a fusion.
### Disadvantages:
*   Wearing out of the implant. The metal and plastic implant is not human tissue, of course, and over time will likely wear out and may require further surgery. A fusion may in fact be necessary if the wear is excessive or there are other complications. Fusions after having an ankle replacement are considerably more difficult, require an inpatient stay, and are less certain of a satisfactory outcome than a primary fusion. How long will the implant last? The short answer is that no one really knows. The implants that are available on the market and are of the latest design have a track record of not longer than 6-8 years. Revision rates (repeat surgery) are quite low in that time frame, but most foot and ankle surgeons suspect that the ultimate lifespan may be in the range of 10-12 years. The longevity of the implant likely depends a great deal on patient specific factors like the underlying cause of the your arthritis, your weight, and activity level.
*   Infection. Just as with knee or hip replacements, infection in the joint replacement is a significant concern. Of course every precaution will be made to prevent this from happening, but a joint replacement creates a joint space where bacteria can grow and the body has difficulty delivering the infection fighting cells and antibiotics to fight them. Dental procedures and other invasive procedures will require a dose of antibiotics prior to the procedure to prevent the small amounts of bacteria that enter your bloodstream from settling in your artificial joint.
*   Wound healing problems. An ankle replacement requires a longer incision and is a much more extensive procedure than a fusion. There are factors that can be improved to lessen your chance of a healing problem.
*   Hospitalization. Most, but not all, ankle replacements require two nights in the hospital for pain relief and physical therapy.
### Other notes:
*   A knee roller is a great help after surgery, and practicing with one ahead of time will be helpful.
*   Return to work is a highly individual question, but almost never before two weeks, even if you have a very sedentary job.
*   This surgery is not offered to active smokers as they are at markedly higher risk for wound problems.
*   Very rarely a complication may develop that is severe enough to warrant an amputation of the leg. Although I have not had this happen after either an ankle fusion or an ankle replacement, most of my colleagues around the country have had at least one, and it warrants at least a mention.
*   Who is the ideal patient for replacement? Age over 55-60, arthritis in the other joints in the foot, knee or hip, and not planning to return to impact activities (running, jogging, etc).

In addition to www.orthoinfo.org, the implant I usually use is the Wright Medical Prophecy with Infinity. You should be aware that I had a minor involvement very early in the development of the Inbone, and Campbell Clinic receives a relatively small financial benefit because of this relationship. I do not have any financial ties to Wright Medical as a consultant or in any other capacity.`,

  'Plantar Fasciitis Overview': {
    content: `Plantar Fasciitis is a very common condition that affects people of all ages. Frequent symptoms include heel pain that is worse upon arising in the morning or when arising from prolonged sitting. Occasionally it feels as if there is a nail driven into your feet or there is burning pain about the heel. These symptoms may be present for months prior to being seen in the doctor's office.

Certain conditions may aggravate this heel pain. These conditions include recent weight gain, a change in activity, such as increasing mileage with running, running on different surfaces, a change in exercise shoes, or worn out shoes.

The heel pain is caused by inflammation of the plantar fascia. This fascia attaches to the heel and occasionally a bone spur is seen on x-ray. This bone spur is only associated with the inflammation and is NOT the cause of the pain.

Treatment is directed at decreasing the inflammation and protecting the heel. Specific treatments we may use are listed below:
1. Stretching of the Achilles tendon, hamstrings and plantar fascia
2. Ice applied for 20 minutes in the evening daily
3. Shoes with support of heels and cushioned mid soles
4. Night splinting (if you have chronic morning symptoms)
5. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Medications (NSAIDS)
6. Orthotic devices
7. Heel pad or heel cups (not effective)

Approximately 90% of patients will improve with these non-operative treatments. But it will take time.

### STRETCHING EXERCISES
**TOWEL STRETCH**
Place a towel by your bed at night. Before getting out of bed in the morning, use the towel to stretch calf muscles and plantar fascia. Place towel around forefoot. Pull the towel toward you while feeling a comfortable stretch in your calf. Hold stretch 30 seconds. Repeat 2-3 times prior to getting out of bed.

**GASTROC STRETCH**
Stand facing the wall. Put involved foot behind the other. Turn foot in slightly. Keep knee straight and heel on the floor. Lean forward until comfortable stretch is felt in calf.

**SOLEUS STRETCH**
Stand facing the wall. Put involved foot behind the other. Turn foot in slightly. Bend knee and imitate a sitting position until stretch is felt in Achilles tendon. Be sure to keep your heel on the floor.

**HAMSTRING STRETCH**
Lie on your back. Place a towel around your foot. Raise your leg with the towel until a stretch is felt in the back of your thigh.

**PLANTAR FASCIA STRETCH**
Place toes on the wall while keeping forefoot on the floor. Keep heel on the floor and your knee straight. Lean hips toward wall until stretch is felt in arch area.

**Hold stretches for one minute.**
**Repeat 5 times per day.**

    content: `### What to Look For
Wearing proper shoes is essential for foot health and can prevent many common problems.

*   **Proper Fit:** Shop for shoes in the afternoon when your feet are largest. There should be about a half-inch of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe.
*   **Good Support:** Look for shoes with a firm heel counter (the part that cups your heel) and good arch support. The shoe should bend at the ball of the foot, not in the middle of the arch.
*   **Activity-Specific:** Wear shoes designed for the activity you are performing (e.g., running shoes for running).

  'Achilles Rupture: Surgery vs. No Surgery': {
    content: `Note: The information below is for mid-substance (most common location) Achilles ruptures
Musculotendinous ruptures (higher ruptures near the calf muscle) heal reliably without surgery
Bony ruptures (sleeve avulsion) at the insertion from the heel bone are unlikely to heal without surgery

### Our Goal: restore Achilles tendon length and tension with low risk of complications

This can be accomplished with or without surgery

### What do we know from the research?
*   1. The management of acute Achilles ruptures remains controversial and is based on each individual patient
*   2. Functional outcomes are similar between surgery versus no surgery at 1 year
a. Myhrvold SB et al. Nonoperative or surgical treatment of acute Achilles' tendon rupture. N Engl J Med 2022
*   3. Smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, and obesity are risk factors for devastating wound complications

### No Surgery
*   1. No surgery = no incision = no wound complications or infections
*   2. No surgery does NOT mean do nothing and it will heal → FUNCTIONAL REHAB is required for good outcome
a. Best candidates: treated early (<72 hrs from injury) + compliant patient + access to functional rehab
*   3. Slightly higher rate of RE-RUPTURE (6.2% without surgery vs. 0.6% with surgery) (2022 study listed above)
a. Many prior studies show NO DIFFERENCE in re-rupture rates as long as functional rehab is used

### Surgery
*   1. Slightly lower rate of re-rupture (0.6%) compared to without surgery (6.2%) (2022 study listed above)
a. Many prior studies show NO DIFFERENCE in re-rupture rates as long as functional rehab is used
*   2. Surgery = incision = risk of wound complications, infections, nerve injury
*   3. May provide quicker return to work/activity
a. 1 study reports 20 days quicker return to work/activity, while others show no difference vs. no surgery
*   4. Open technique: longer operating times, higher superficial infection rates (6%), higher ankle stiffness
a. Lower rate of nerve injury
*   5. Minimally Invasive Technique: smaller incision = lower infection rates (0.4%) vs. open approach (6%)
a. Higher rate of nerve injury (5.2%) vs. open surgery (2.8%)
b. Quicker operative time (30 minutes vs. 50 minutes in open group)
*   6. No difference in re-rupture or functional outcomes between open versus minimally invasive

### Bottom Line: SHARED DECISION between patient and surgeon based on:
Patient health factors
Lifestyle
Risk/Benefit

Regardless of what you decide, REHAB is the most important part of treatment`,
